## What is Anvil? ##
Anvil is a UNIX code editor written entirely in C.

This code editor is fast and easy to use. It's great for editing files and programs
on any machine running UNIX. It could be your new server, your computer, or even 
your Raspberry Pi! All shortcuts and commands are very easy to learn. Anvil doesn't 
use commands like `:wq` lik you could see in Vim but instead `Ctrl-Key` commands. 
This way, users who already have experience and knowledge of shortcuts used in 
VSC, Jetbrains IDEs, or Sublime Text, should feel at home and the learning curve 
shouldn't be too steep!

As of right now, Anvil as only been tested on UNIX systems (MacOS & Ubuntu)

## Running ##
